    "==========================\n",
    "Given a list of base compound names and molecular weights, this notebook calculates possible derivatives (e.g. metabolites) in 2 phases, and adds adducts and losses resulting in a list of possible ion masses with labels.\n",
    "The intention is that this be used with the PCVG compound finding code, and the idea is that once we have a suggested identification, e.g. ibuprofen, we can calculate other potential masses and look for matches with the ions we've found. This eliminates a lot of manual calculations and allows interactive investigation, e.g. if we find an adduct that corresponds to addition of C2H3O2Na we can quickly incorporate it into our lists and see if it shows up elsewhere. It also allows us to look for forms that we might not otherwise consider."

For example, vinpocetin shows a loss of C2H4, possibly following oxidations, which then undergoes further pahase 1 and 2 modifications so the base_compound list contains both Vinpo and Apo-vinpo.\n",
