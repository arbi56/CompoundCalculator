    "Given a list of base compound names and molecular weights, this notebook calculates possible derivatives (e.g. metabolites) in 2 phases, and adds adducts and losses resulting in a list of possible ion masses with labels.\n",
    "The intention is that this be used with the PCVG compound finding code, and the idea is that once we have a suggested identification, e.g. ibuprofen, we can calculate other potential masses and look for matches with the ions we've found. This eliminates a lot of manual calculations and allows interactive investigation, e.g. if we find an adduct that corresponds to addition of C2H3O2Na we can quickly incorporate it into our lists and see if it shows up elsewhere. It also allows us to look for forms that we might not otherwise consider. However the calculated mass lists can also be used interactively with complex spectra, for example by haveing the calculator in one window and the matching notebook in another."

    "The base compound information is now a list of (name, mass) tuples which provides a way to incorporate specific known modifications. For example, vinpocetin shows a loss of C2H4, possibly following oxidations, which then undergoes further pahase 1 and 2 modifications so the base_compound list contains both Vinpo and Apo-vinpo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output can now include heterodimers which are calculated by generating new compounds from all pairs of modified compounds, i.e. after the phase 1 and phase 2 nodifications have been generated but prior to generating the final list with adducts.

    "An extra field ('Root') has been added to Composition; this tracks the initial compound in each derived composition so they can be easily sorted and filtered later. This is useful when the base compound list contains several compounds as in interactive spectrum analysis where unknowns, fragments, etc. can be added to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases ions corresponding to adduct clusters are observed in the spectrum, for example JChromA 2019(1600)-174; this can now be accomodated by seting *include_adducts_as_compounds* = True. These most likely are not simply due to the small cations (Na, K) but require additional moieties, such as formate or acetate, which can be specified via *adduct_as_compound_must_have*; the mass range can also be restricted.\n",
